# Real-time-Weather-Analysis



This repository contains my project on analyzing real-time weather data, which I developed to deepen my understanding of data science and API interaction. By utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API, I've gathered weather information like temperature, humidity, and pressure to uncover insightful trends. The project is built with Python and employs several libraries, including Requests for fetching data, Pandas for its organization and analysis, and Matplotlib along with Seaborn for visualizing the findings. My aim was to create a tool that could offer valuable insights for practical applications such as environmental monitoring and urban planning. This project highlights my journey in mastering Python programming, API usage, data manipulation, and creating meaningful visual representations of complex datasets.
